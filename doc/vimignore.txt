INTRODUCTION                                                 *vimignore-intro*


I came up with the idea for this plugin when I was working on various projects
with partners and would need to reconfigure the gitignore file for the
project. I had to do this often enough that I felt that it should flow more
natively in vim.

I decided to make this plugin to facilitate the process. Vimignore offers a
few different commands for making sure the appropriate files are ignored.

FUGITIVE INTEGRATION                          *vimignore-fugitive-integration*


The best way to use this plugin is in conjunction with Tim Pope's fugitive
plugin (www.github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive). In particular, when using the
|:Gstatus| command, Vimignore adds a mapping on I.

Press 'I' when viewing the git index (|:Gstatus| window) to add the file on
the current line to the gitignore list and update the git index accordingly.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                  *vimignore-commands*

:GEditIgnore[!]                                                 *:GEditIgnore*
  Find and open the appropriate .gitignore file for editing.

  This also sets 'bufhidden' for this buffer as follows:
    * If this file is already open, 'bufhidden' is not touched
    * If the '!' is supplied, this will leave 'bufhidden' untouched
    * Otherwise, 'bufhidden' will be set to delete

:GIgnoreCurrentFile[!]                                   *:GIgnoreCurrentFile*
  Append the current file to the .gitignore list. This internally uses the
  |:GEditIgnore| command, so be aware of side effects due to compatibility
  issues with the 'hidden' option.

  By default, this will check the gitignore list to avoid adding duplicate
  entries. If the '!' is provided, this will not check for duplicates.

:GAddToIgnore[!] {fname1} [fnames...]                          *:GAddToIgnore*
  Add each file fname1, fname2, etc. to the .gitignore list. This takes one or
  more arguments

  By default, this will check the gitignore list to avoid adding duplicate
  entries. If the '!' is provided, this will not check for duplicates.

:GIgnoreDefaults[!]                                         *:GIgnoreDefaults*
  Add sensible defaults to the .gitignore list. This adds .DS_Store, Vim swap
  files, and Vim backup files to the list to prevent these from winding up
  under version control.

  When the '!' is supplied, this will add them to the ignore list without
  checking for duplicates.
